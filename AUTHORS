Other notes:
============
The file cipher/rndunix.c is heavily based on Peter Gutmann's
rndunix.c from cryptlib. - He promised to add the GPL as an alternative
license to this and some other files.  We don't have a dissclaimer for
this file, but due to the fact that this is only needed for non-free
system we can easily remove this from the distribution and put it as
a module on some FTP server.
