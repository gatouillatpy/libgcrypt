Other notes:
============
This program uses the zlib compression library written by
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

Most of the stuff in mpi has been taken from the GMP library.
[Who is the author??]

The keybox implementation is based on GDBM 1.7.3 by Philip A. Nelson.

The file cipher/rndunix.c is based on Peter Gutmann's rndunix.c from
cryptlib. - He promised to add the GPL as an alternative license to
this and some other files.  We don't have a disclaimer yet, but due
to the fact that this is only needed for non-free systems we can
easily remove this from the distribution and put it as an extra module
on the FTP server.

The files in debian/ are by James Troup who is the Debian maintainer
for GnuPG.

The RPM specs file scripts/gnupg.spec has been contributed by
several people.
