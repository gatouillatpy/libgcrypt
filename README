		    libgcrypt - The GNU crypto library
		   ------------------------------------
  			    Version 1.1

        	WARNING:  This is work in PROGRESS!

Libgcrypt is a general purpose crypto library based on the code used
in GnuPG.  We can't start with a new version number becuase libgcrypt
was part of gnupg 1.1 and some applications already used it and tested
for the version number. We believe that the API can stay as it is,
except that new functions may be added in the future.

This is a development version, the first stable version will be 1.2.0.

If you are using the CVS version, make sure that you have the latest
automake (I am using Debian Sid) and run ./autogen.sh to create
configure.
