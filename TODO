* switching from encrypt to decrypt requires a close and open.
  Wouldn't it be better if we have a reset function or integrate that
  with setkey?

* add more tests.  Even basic is very minimal.

* udiv-qrnbd.o should get build as *.lo [HPUX]

* Define a function to be used as a constructor to set up things in a
  MT safe way.  There is already a hook for this.

* Allow operation using RSA keys consisting of the OpenSSL list of
  paramemters and allow for a third form where the private Exponent
  is not given (saves space)
