* switching from encrypt to decrypt requires a close and open.
  Wouldn't it be better if we have a reset function or integrate that
  with setkey?

* add more tests.  Even basic is very minimal.

* udiv-qrnbd.o should get build as *.lo [HPUX]

* Allow operation using RSA keys consisting of the OpenSSL list of
  parameters and allow for a third form where the private Exponent
  is not given (saves space).
