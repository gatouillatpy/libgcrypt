Hello! 

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.4.1.  This is a maintenance release to fix a few problems.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building
blocks.  It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not
provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough
understanding of applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.1 (2008-04-25)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a bug introduced by 1.3.1 which led to the comsumption of far
   too much entropy for the intial seeding.

 * Improved AES performance for CFB and CBC modes.

 * Removed build problems for the Padlock support.


Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as
listed at http://www.gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html .  On the primary
server the source file and its digital signatures is:

For help on developing with Libgcrypt you should read the included
manual and optional ask on the gcrypt-devel mailing list [1].

Improving Libgcrypt is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libgcrypt useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software [2], order
extensions or support or more general by donating money to the Free
Software movement [3].

Commercial support contracts for Libgcrypt are available [4], and they
help finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf
based company, is currently funding Libgcrypt development.  We are
always looking for interesting development projects.

Many thanks to all who contributed to Libgcrypt development, be it bug
fixes, code, documentation, testing or helping users.

Happy hacking,

  Werner
