Hello! 

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.4.2.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building
blocks.  It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not
provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough
understanding of applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2:

 * The long missing gcry_mpi_lshift function has been added.

 * RSA key generation now supports a "transient-key" flag.

 * The keygrip computation for ECDSA has been implemented thus ECDSA
   is now fully supported.

 * A few macros have been replaced by functions for better type
   checking.

 * The thread initialization structure now carries version
   information.

 * The manual describes more clearly how to initialize Libgcrypt.

 * The library may now be switched into a FIPS mode.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.3.0 release:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GCRYCTL_OPERATIONAL_P   NEW.
 GCRYCTL_FIPS_MODE_P     NEW.
 GCRYCTL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE NEW.
 gcry_cipher_setkey      NEW: Replaces macro.
 gcry_cipher_setiv       NEW: Replaces macro.
 gcry_cipher_setctr      NEW: Replaces macro.
 gcry_mpi_lshift         NEW.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For help on developing with Libgcrypt you should read the included
manual and optional ask on the gcrypt-devel mailing list [1].

Improving Libgcrypt is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libgcrypt useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software [2], order
extensions or support or more general by donating money to the Free
Software movement [3].

Commercial support contracts for Libgcrypt are available [4], and they
help finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf
based company, is currently funding Libgcrypt development.  We are
always looking for interesting development projects.

Many thanks to all who contributed to Libgcrypt development, be it bug
fixes, code, documentation, testing or helping users.


Happy hacking,

  Werner
