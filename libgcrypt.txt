%%name: Libgcrypt

%%short-description: Cryptographic library

%%full-description: This is a general purpose cryptographic library
based on the code from GnuPG.  It provides functions for all
cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric ciphers
(AES,DES,Blowfish,CAST5,Twofish,Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD5,
RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms),
public key algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions,
random numbers and a lot of supporting functions.
